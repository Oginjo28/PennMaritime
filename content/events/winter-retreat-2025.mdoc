      Our first-ever Winter Retreat was absolutely phenomenal—exactly what Maritime@Penn needed to kick off 2025 with unstoppable momentum.

      Watching our members come together in the beautiful Poconos, away from the hustle of campus life, was truly special. This wasn't just a retreat; it was the foundation for the incredible year ahead.

      From strategic planning sessions that shaped our 2025 roadmap to late-night conversations by the fireplace that forged lifelong friendships, every moment reinforced why Maritime@Penn is more than just a club—we're a family.

      The energy, creativity, and passion our members brought to every activity was inspiring. We left the Poconos not just as colleagues, but as a unified team ready to make waves in the maritime industry.

      Here's to the memories we made and the incredible journey ahead. This retreat set the tone for what's going to be our most impactful year yet.
